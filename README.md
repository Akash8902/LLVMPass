LLVM Pass for Tracking Memory Write Operations
This project contains source code files and an LLVM pass for tracking memory write operations in C++ programs.

Files
sample.cpp: This is an example source code file that contains NVM writes. This file can be used to test the LLVM pass.

llvm.cpp: This file contains the implementation of the LLVM pass that instruments the original code to track memory write operations.

writeNVM.cpp: This file contains the implementation of a runtime library function called writeNVM() that logs NVM write operations to a log file.

llvm_pass.sh: This is a shell script that automates the process of running the LLVM pass on the original source code, linking it with the writeNVM() function, and running the resulting executable to log NVM write operations.

nvm_write.log: This file is generated by the llvm_pass.sh script and contains the log of NVM write operations.

How to Use
To use the LLVM pass to track memory write operations, follow these steps:

Ensure that LLVM is installed on your system.

Compile the LLVM pass by running the following command in the terminal:

vbnet
Copy code
clang++ -shared -fPIC llvm.cpp -o libNVMInstrumentPass.so
Compile the source code to LLVM IR using Clang, by running the following command:

Copy code
clang++ -S -emit-llvm sample.cpp -o sample.ll
Run the LLVM pass on the LLVM IR generated in the previous step, to instrument the NVM write instructions:

bash
Copy code
opt -load ./libNVMInstrumentPass.so -NVMInstrumentPass -S sample.ll -o sample.instrumented.ll
Compile the writeNVM() function to a shared object file, by running the following command:

vbnet
Copy code
clang++ -shared -fPIC writeNVM.cpp -o libwriteNVM.so
Link the instrumented LLVM IR with the writeNVM() function using a runtime library, by running the following command:

csharp
Copy code
clang++ sample.instrumented.ll -L. -lwriteNVM -o a.out
Run the resulting executable to log NVM write operations:

bash
Copy code
./a.out > nvm_write.log
